<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<br>

## ‚ôæÔ∏è About The Project

Vishwakarma Labs is a software application designed to facilitate lab sessions for educational institutions. The application provides various features to help both the students and the lab instructor to have an interactive and productive lab session. The application allows multiple participants to join the server and participate in the lab session. Each participant is required to enter their name and roll number before joining the session. The server then stores this information along with the date and time the participant joined the session.

The attendance feature in the application ensures that the participants attend the session for a minimum duration before marking them present. The minimum duration is set by the lab instructor and can be changed based on the requirements of the lab session. The attendance is recorded in a CSV file that can be easily accessed and maintained by the lab instructor. The application also provides a chatroom feature where the participants can interact with each other and the lab instructor. This feature can be used to discuss any queries or doubts related to the lab session. The timer feature is also included in the application to ensure that the lab session is conducted within the allotted time. The timer is set by the lab instructor and can be modified based on the requirements of the lab session.

Overall, Vishwakarma Labs is a user-friendly and efficient software application that helps to conduct lab sessions in an organized and interactive manner.
